# NostalgiaRPG
A simple turn-based RPG written in Allegro 5
Program includes: basic collision detection, black and white sprite map edge detection, turn based combat system, overworld, enemy logic, multiple weapons to equip

***The music used in game is open source and NOT created by myself, Josh Chartrand, or any other contributors to this project (Armine Alex Hollohan and Erica Lekawski)

This was a collaberative assignment coded by myself and two other partners, names stated above.

I was responsible for the overall game logic (Game.cpp + Game.h), player movement and logic (Player.cpp + Player.h), physics (Physics.cpp + Physics.h), opening chests and obtaining items (Chest.cpp + Chest.h), incorporating some enemy logic and extracting various in-game sprites.
  
Sprites were obtained from open source RPG Maker XP assets. The characters were generated from a character maker.
